Getting to play with my very own virtual tomagatchi was like being a kid again and I\'m very happy with how this project came out.'

        description: 'Delsecto derives from "from bugs". Chase Shaeff and I took on this project with the intent of creating a place where people were able to share their debugging issues while programming. We mainly wanted to target the cohort we were attending at General Assembly but it could realistically be used by all. It is a comfortable environment where programmers can help other programmers hone their skills.'

        description: 'Storm Chaserz was such a fun project! Timothy Moy, Sky McMahon and I worked together with students from the UX design cohort to create a storm tracking website. The goal of this project was not to create a fully functional web page but to have experience working with UX designers and creating a project that stays within the scope of what they\'d asked of us.'

Melisa Larson, Brian Sanches and myself took on this project together and were able to create a place where travelers are able to leave info about places that they\'ve been to. This was a lot fo fun because we had the opportunity to use Python and Django for this project.'
